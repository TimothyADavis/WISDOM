<b>WISDOM MEMBER</b><br>
<i>Current Position:</i> Postdoctoral Researcher, Institute for Computational Science, University of Zurich, Switzerland<br>
<!--more-->
<br>
<i>Role in WISDOM:</i> Jindra is interested in understanding the physics of the insterstellar medium, star formation and quenching, in particular how these can be impacted by the underlying gravitational potential/morphology of galaxies. As a numericist, she mostly uses simulations to answer her research questions. WISDOM is her foray into also working with observational data. Jindra is currently working on comparing the interstellar medium morphologies of simulated galaxies to those in WISDOM, trying to quantify the impact of the galactic gravitational potential on the central gas disc using power spectra.
