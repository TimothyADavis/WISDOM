<br>
<i>Role in WISDOM:</i> Lijie specialises in observational radio/(sub)mm astronomy, interstellar medium, star formation and galaxy evolution. Her research focuses on understanding the galaxy-scale and cloud-scale ISM properties and how these properties regulate the star formation in different galactic environments. Specifically, her research fields include the physical properties and dynamics of the ISM in nearby and high-z galaxies, the resolved properties of giant molecular clouds in different types of galaxies, and the SF-law from GMC-scale to galaxy-scale over cosmic time.
