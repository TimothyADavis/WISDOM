<b>WISDOM STUDENT</b><br>
<i>Current Position:</i> PhD student, McGill Space Institute, Canada<br>

<br>
<i>Role in WISDOM:</i> Hope uses space- and ground-based telescopes to study the relationship between supermassive black holes, the material accreting around them, and the centres of galaxies. As a part of WISDOM, she models the gravitational potential of galactic centres using known stellar distributions and high-resolution kinematics of molecular gas to constrain the presence and mass of SMBHs. She also coordinates observations with SITELLE, a fourier-transform spectrograph on CFHT, to measure the star formation efficiency of gas in the centres of WISDOM galaxies. Currently, she is completing her PhD at the <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca/">McGill Space Institute</a> working with <a href="https://wisdom-project.org/teamafil/DarylHaggard/">Prof. Daryl Haggard</a> in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/indigenous/land-and-peoples/learn-about-land-and-peoples-tiohtiake-montreal">Tiohtià:ke</a> (Montréal, QC).
