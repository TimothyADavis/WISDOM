<i>Role in WISDOM:</i> Ilariaâ€™s interests are mainly in the field of galaxy formation and evolution, with a special focus on the investigation of the mutual interplay between central SMBHs and their host galaxies. Her research mostly consists in multi-wavelength studies of AGN host galaxies and associated AGN feeding/feedback processes, spatially-resolved analyses of cold gas physics and kinematics in nearby galaxies, and investigations of the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations.
