<b>Abstract</b><br>
We present high-resolution (synthesized beam size 0.088" × 0.083" or 25×23 pc<sup>2</sup>) Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array 12CO(2-1) line and 236 GHz continuum observations, as well as 5 GHz enhanced Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) continuum observations, of NGC 0708; the brightest galaxy in the low-mass galaxy cluster Abell 262. The line observations reveal a turbulent, rotating disc of molecular gas in the core of the galaxy, and a high-velocity, blueshifted feature ≍0.4" (≍113 pc) from its centre. The submillimetre continuum emission peaks at the nucleus, but extends towards this anomalous CO emission feature. No corresponding elongation is found on the same spatial scales at 5 GHz with e-MERLIN. We discuss potential causes for the anomalous blueshifted emission detected in this source, and conclude that it is most likely to be a low-mass in-falling filament of material condensing from the hot intracluster medium via chaotic cold accretion, but it is also possible that it is a jet-driven molecular outflow. We estimate the physical properties this structure has in these two scenarios, and show that either explanation is viable. We suggest future observations with integral field spectrographs will be able to determine the true cause of this anomalous emission, and provide further evidence for interaction between quenched cooling flows and mechanical feedback on both small and large scales in this source.
