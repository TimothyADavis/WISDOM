Please find below the data released along with <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1522D/abstract'>WISDOM Paper X</a>. Please cite that work if you use this data for your science. If you use the continuum data, please also cite <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.528..319E/abstract'>WISDOM Paper XVI</a>.<br>


<br>Each folder contains the data cube, along with a set of derived data products. These were created using the <a href='../codes/pymakeplots/'>pymakeplots</a> package, using the masked-moments technique.<br>

Specifically, we include the (primary beam corrected): 
<ol>
<li>CO moment zero (integrated intensity).</li>
<li>CO moment one (intensity weighted mean velocity).</li>
<li>CO moment two (observed line of sight velocity dispersion - NOTE: this is not the same as the intrinsic dispersion and will be heavily affected by channelisation and beam smearing in regions with large velocity gradients).</li>
<li>CO line spectrum (with and without masking). </li>
<li>Millimetre continuum map, where emission was detected.</li>
</ol>
