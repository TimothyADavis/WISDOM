introduction: |

 The WISDOM (mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses) project is making very high resolution observations of nearby galaxy centres with several telescopes, including ALMA, CFHT and the VLA. 
 
 We aim to&#58;
 - Develop and calibrate the use of molecular gas as a tracer for measuring supermasive black hole masses
 - Use these advances to tie down SMBH-host relations across the Hubble sequence with a single technique.
 - Explore how the evolution and properties of molecular clouds are mediated by the extreme environments present in galaxy centres.
 - Investigate how cloud-scale ISM properties vary in different galactic environments of galaxy centres (nuclear discs, spiral arms, bar and gas flows).
 - Explore the extreme environments present in galaxy centres, and the gas flows that fuel AGN
 - Understand the physical processes regulating star formation within individual GMCs across the Hubble sequence, which in turn impacts our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies in general.
