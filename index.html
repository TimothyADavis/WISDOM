introduction: |

 The WISDOM (mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses) project is making very high resolution observations of nearby galaxy centres with several telescopes, including ALMA, CFHT and the VLA. 
 
 We aim to&#58;
 - Develop and calibrate the use of molecular gas as a tracer for measuring supermasive black hole masses
 - Use these advances to tie down SMBH-host relations across the Hubble sequence with a single technique.
 - Explore the extreme environments present in galaxy centres, and how they affect cloud statistics, star formation and gas flows in galaxy centers that fuel AGN
